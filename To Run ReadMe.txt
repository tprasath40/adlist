I have two folder in git, 
1. server folder for server files
2. Task folder for front end (I used Ionic framework for this)

*in Front end Task folder I didnt add platform because its automatically fetch node_modules files.

How To run server:
1. Go to server folder in terminal
2. type nodemon app.js to run the server. (before that we need configure database)

how to run Frontend(Task):
1. go to task folder in terminal
2. type Ionic serve. its open UI in default browser

Server(NodeJs):

I used Node js in backend. In NodeJs I have used modules are,
1. Express
2. bodyParser - to use json in body
3. mysql - connect server into mysql database
4. nodemon - Deduct changes and auto load
5. Sequelize - ORM

Front End:
I used Ionic framework
